Thank you for completing the Egg Exam. Now, If you excuse me, the scores were so horrendous for this class that I will 
see all of you in therapy. Like- my expectations for this class was low, but not THAT LOW. You could call it an
Egg-extremely painful class to teach! Heh... That just added another paycheque to my therapist's bill.


Ahem. Now that the joke answer is out of the way.

Laurie, thank you so much for making this semester an absolute joy to attend. 

I've always been the shy person, 
but I'll speak on behalf of our group that we really appreciated you kicking our ass a little bit
and making us better programmers with your feedback and being involved
with our learning process. 

I could not imagine a better person in this world
to instruct and facilitate this material. We always enjoyed coming in
every Monday because of that fun happy energy and learning something new.

It really means a lot to me that you were so kind and accommodating.
I was kinda scared, haha, to ask for an extension on the quizzes.

We hope you have yourself an amazing retirement! Thank you once again
for being part of our journey, and pushing us so that we can become better.

We'll see you at Grad!
 
 - Your favourite students.
